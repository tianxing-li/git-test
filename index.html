        <p>Seven times have Idespised my soul</p>
        <p>The first time when I saw her being meek that she might attain height. </p>
        <p>The second time when I saw her limping before the crippled. </p>
        <p>The third time when she was given to choose between the hard and the easy, and she chose the easy. </p>
        <p>The fourth time when she committed a wrong, and comforted herself that others also commit wrong. </p>
        <p>The fifth time when she forbore for weakness, and attributed her patience to strength. </p>
        <p>The sixth time when she despised the ugliness of a face, and knew not that it was one of her own masks. </p>
        <p>And the seventh time when she sang a song of praise, and deemed it a virtue. </p>
